/*
1. Similar to Strategy
2. Typical implementation:
	a. Defne an interface with common operations
	b. Make use of those operations inside a function
3. Alternative functional approach
	a. Make a function that takes several functions
	b. Can pass in functions that capture local state
	c. No need for either structs of interfaces
